# Multiplayer-Snake-Game-Verilog
A 2-player snake game created using verilog on FPGA board. This was the final project for the course 
Digital Logic Design (DLD). 

# Logistics 
- A FPGA board which would the main processor 
- A PS2 keyboard for input
- A VGA monitor to display the output 

# Game Instructions::
- Player1 would use the arrow keys | Player2 would use wsda to control its snake
